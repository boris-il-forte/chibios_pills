# Chibios Pills

Two simple demos to run ChibiOS on the BluePill and the BlackPillv2 boards.
The projects and Makefiles are meant to be used with ChibiStudio, and the IDE is supposed to be found in /opt/ChibiStudio.
You can easily change the project variables and point to the correct ChibiStudio Path.

Both projects contains the launcher to run openocd using the stlink-v2 debugger.

The folder openocd contains board files to be copied in the openocd script/board folder (use openocd provided by ChibiStudio).
